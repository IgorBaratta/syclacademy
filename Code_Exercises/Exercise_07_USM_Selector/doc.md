# SYCL Academy

## Exercise 7: USM Selector
---

In this exercise you will learn how to find a suitable device for using the USM data management model.

---

### 1.) Create a device selector

Create a custom device selector as you did in exercise 5. Within this device selector check for whether the 
device being inspected has support for the USM device allocations. There are some hints in the source file.

This can be querying for the `aspect::usm_device_allocations` aspect.

### 3.) Create a queue

Once you have a device selector which will choose a device which supports USM
create a `queue` using it to select it's device, remember to handle errors.


#### Build And Execution Hints

For For DPC++ (using the Intel DevCloud):
```sh
dpcpp -o sycl-ex-7 -I../External/Catch2/single_include ../Code_Exercises/Exercise_07_USM_Selector/source.cpp
```
In Intel DevCloud, to run computational applications, you will submit jobs to a queue for execution on compute nodes,
especially some features like longer walltime and multi-node computation is only abvailable through the job queue.
Please refer to the [guide][devcloud-job-submission].

So wrap the binary into a script `job_submission` and run:
```sh
qsub job_submission
```

For ComputeCpp:
```sh
cmake -DSYCL_ACADEMY_USE_COMPUTECPP=ON -DSYCL_ACADEMY_INSTALL_ROOT=/insert/path/to/computecpp ..
make exercise_07_usm_selector_source
./Code_Exercises/Exercise_07_USM_Selector/exercise_07_usm_selector_source
```


For hipSYCL:
```sh
# <target specification> is a list of backends and devices to target, for example
# "omp;hip:gfx900,gfx906" compiles for CPUs with the OpenMP backend and for AMD Vega 10 (gfx900) and Vega 20 (gfx906) GPUs using the HIP backend.
# The simplest target specification is "omp" which compiles for CPUs using the OpenMP backend.
cmake -DSYCL_ACADEMY_USE_HIPSYCL=ON -DSYCL_ACADEMY_INSTALL_ROOT=/insert/path/to/hipsycl -DHIPSYCL_TARGETS="<target specification>" ..
make exercise_07_usm_selector_source
./Code_Exercises/Exercise_07_USM_Selector/exercise_07_usm_selector_source
```
alternatively, without cmake:
```sh
cd Code_Exercises/Exercise_07_USM_Selector
/path/to/hipsycl/bin/syclcc -o sycl-ex-7 -I../../External/Catch2/single_include --hipsycl-targets="<target specification>" source.cpp
./sycl-ex-7
```
