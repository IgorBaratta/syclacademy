# SYCL Academy - IWOCL & SYCLcon 2022

![SYCL Academy](sycl_academy.png "SYCL Academy")

This repository provides materials that can be used for teaching SYCL. The
materials are provided using the "Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0
International" license.

These materials have been adapted for the SYCL tutorial at IWOCL and SYCLcon.
See the main branch of this repository for all the materials available.

### How to use the Materials

To use these materials simply clone this repository including the required submodules.

```
git clone --branch iwocl22 --recursive https://github.com/codeplaysoftware/syclacademy.git
```

The lectures are written in reveal.js, and can be found in `Lesson_Materials`,
in the sub-directory for each topic. To view them simply open the `index.html`
file in your browser. Your browser will have a "Full Screen" mode that can be
used to run the presentation, use the right and left cursors to move forward and
backward in the presentation.

The exercises can be found in `Code_Exercises` in the sub-directory for each
topic. Each exercise has a markdown document instructing what to do in the
exercise, a source file to start with and a solution file to provide an
example implementation to compare against.

## Setting up the Intel DevCloud

There are multiple SYCL implementations but for simplicity due to the limited 
time during the SYCLcon training we will use the Intel DevCloud which is 
pre-configured with the DPC++ compiler.

Go to the [Intel DevCloud](https://tinyurl.com/getdevcloud) to set up your 
environment. You will need to register or log in.

There are two options to connect to the DevCloud: via SSH or using JupyterLab.
It is recommended to use the JupyterLab terminal for simplicity.

Go to [this page](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get_started/) and scroll to the 
bottom of the page. Then click on the 'Launch JupyterLab*' link on the bottom of the 
page to connect with the Jupyter* Lab.

You will then see a "Welcome to Jupyter Notebooks on the Intel DevCloud for oneAPI 
Projects!" document which covers the basics of the JupyterLab access to the Intel 
DevCloud for oneAPI Projects.

**To do the exercises for this tutorial select File -> New -> Terminal and open a 
terminal window. This gives you command line access to the cloud machine.**

## Lesson Curriculum for IWOCL & SYCLcon 22

The SYCL Academy curriculum is divided up into a number of short lessons
consisting of slides for presenting the material and a more detailed write-up,
each accompanied by a tutorial for getting hands on experience with the subject
matter.

Each of the lessons are designed to be self contained modules in order to
support both academic and training style teaching environments.
