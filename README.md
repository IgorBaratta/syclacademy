These materials have been adapted for the SYCL tutorial at IWOCL and SYCLcon.
See the main branch of this repository for all the materials available.

## What is SYCL?

If you're not familiar with SYCL or would like some further resources for
learning about SYCL below are a list of useful resources:

*  Read a description of SYCL on the [Khronos website SYCL page](https://www.khronos.org/sycl/).
*  Go to the Khronos website to find [a list of SYCL resources](https://www.khronos.org/sycl/resources).
*  Check out the [SYCL 2020 reference guide](https://www.khronos.org/registry/SYCL/).
*  Browse SYCL news, blog posts, videos, projects and more on the [sycl.tech community website](https://sycl.tech/)
*  Get a list of the [available SYCL implementations](https://sycl.tech/#get-sycl)

### How to use the Materials

To use these materials simply clone this repository including the required submodules.

```
git clone --branch iwocl22 --recursive https://github.com/codeplaysoftware/syclacademy.git
```

The lectures are written in reveal.js, and can be found in `Lesson_Materials`,
in the sub-directory for each topic. To view them simply open the `index.html`
file in your browser. Your browser will have a "Full Screen" mode that can be
used to run the presentation, use the right and left cursors to move forward and
backward in the presentation.

The exercises can be found in `Code_Exercises` in the sub-directory for each
topic. Each exercise has a markdown document instructing what to do in the
exercise, a source file to start with and a solution file to provide an
example implementation to compare against.

## Lesson Curriculum for IWOCL & SYCLcon 22

The SYCL Academy curriculum is divided up into a number of short lessons
consisting of slides for presenting the material and a more detailed write-up,
each accompanied by a tutorial for getting hands on experience with the subject
matter.

Each of the lessons are designed to be self contained modules in order to
support both academic and training style teaching environments.
